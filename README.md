This is a Rust implementation of a simple elementary cellular automaton (ECA) simulation that follows the rules specified by a given rule set. 

## Elementary Cellular Automaton

Elementary Cellular Automaton is a one-dimensional array of cells, each having two possible states (usually represented as 0 or 1). The state of each cell evolves over discrete time steps based on a set of rules, typically defined by a binary number.

## Implementation Overview

### Dependencies

The code uses the following dependencies from the standard library:
```rust
use std::io::Write;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;
```

### Function Signature

```rust
pub fn run_eca<W>(
    threads: usize,
    rule: [bool; 8],
    size: usize,
    steps: usize,
    indices: Vec<usize>,
    write: Option<W>,
) -> ((usize, usize), (usize, usize), usize)
where
    W: Write + Send + 'static,
{
    // Function implementation...
}
```

### Parameters
- `threads`: Number of threads to use for parallel processing.
- `rule`: The rule set for the elementary cellular automaton.
- `size`: The size of the cellular automaton array.
- `steps`: The number of steps to simulate.
- `indices`: Initial indices of active cells.
- `write`: Optional output stream for visualizing the simulation.

### Parallelization

The simulation is parallelized using multiple threads, each responsible for a portion of the cellular automaton.

### Communication Channels

The code uses `mpsc` channels for communication between threads. Channels are created for sending and receiving data between left and right neighbors, as well as for visualizing the state if required.

### Simulation Loop

The main simulation loop iterates over the specified number of steps. In each step:
- The current state is communicated between neighboring threads.
- The rule set is applied to determine the next state.
- Popcount (number of active cells) is sent to the main thread for analysis.
